# ArteEval
ArteEval is an evaluation framework designed to quantitatively assess the performance of 3D reconstruction methods for archaeological artifacts. It provides a suite of geometry-based and perceptual metrics to benchmark reconstruction accuracy, completeness, and fidelity, enabling fair and interpretable comparisons across different techniques.
